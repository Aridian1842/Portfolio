#Project Miles Ahead(In Progress)  
Building off the TensorFlow model [Magenta](https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta), Project "Miles Ahead" will attempt to enhance Deep Learning Jazz Generation by enhancing the recurrent neural network "Lookback RNN".

Through the use of Music21 and matplotlib, I then perform Exploratory Data Analysis and robust Data Visualization to explore the music created by the model.  Utilizing the same comparison on music created legendary jazz pianist, Bill Evans, I will seek insight in to the "humanity" of the computer generated music.

*Project is in progress and will be updated as work is completed.*
