# Exploratory Data Analysis

Utilizing Music 21 and matplotlib, Project Miles Ahead will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis and robust Data Visualization to explore the music created by the model.  Utilizing the same comparison on music created by legendary jazz pianist, Bill Evans, this project seeks insight in to the "humanity" of the computer generated music.

Run `parser.py` in command line to extract the following:

notes: Note/Rest, Octave, Len, Offset:

![notes](https://github.com/Mithers/Portfolio/blob/master/Project%20Miles%20Ahead/Assets/notes.png)

chords: FullName, CommonName, Len, Offset:

![chords](https://github.com/Mithers/Portfolio/blob/master/Project%20Miles%20Ahead/Assets/chords.png)

This allows you to put that information in to a pandas data frame and perform analysis.

##See jupyter notebook entitled "EDA.ipynb" for actual analysis.
